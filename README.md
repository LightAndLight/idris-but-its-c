# Idris, but it's C

A silly experiment where I build a type-safe, HOAS syntax tree for a small
C-like language. By way of some syntax extensions, Idris will parse some valid
C code into a [value which represents the corresponding program](https://github.com/LightAndLight/idris-but-its-c/blob/master/HOAS.idr#L160).
